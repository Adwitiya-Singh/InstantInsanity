For every puzzle:
   if every colour occurs only thrice:
   		Call the solve method on it
   		if the solve returns false:
   	 		//This means that there exists a solution but it requires flipping one or more slices
			Call minimum obstacle from the smallest size until we find one
		if solve returns true:
   	 		Print the answer
   	if colours occurs more than thrice:
   	 	Get a list of all colours that occur more than 3 times
   	 	For every colour that occurs more than thrice:
   	 		Get a list of all the slices that contain that colour
   	 		Those slices are a minimum obstacles
   	 		If all the minumum obstacles returned are of size n:
   	 			Try and find minimum obstalces of size 2 to n in the puzzle:
   	 				If they exist, then they're the minimum obstacle


How solve works
   Solve is recursive and tries to insert blocks until it finds a conflict at which point it returns to the previous call of the recrusive funtion and rotates the previous slice and then tries inserting again.

   If a slice has been rotates three times and there are still obstacles, solve returns false.

How minimum obstacle works:
   To find all minimum obstacles of size n:
       We find all subsets of slices in the puzzle of size n and see if any of those are unsolvable:
           If any of those are unsolvabe then it's a minimum obstacle
